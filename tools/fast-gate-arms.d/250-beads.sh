# case table that used to live in tools/fast-gate.sh. The rationale comments travel with
# the arm they explain (ADR 0001's assertion-consumer rule). Read README.md in this directory
# before adding an arm: PRECEDENCE IS THE NUMERIC PREFIX, and the first matching arm wins.

    # --- Ignore list (agents-9nir) -----------------------------------------------------
    # RULE: an ignore must be a DELIBERATE CASE ARM WITH A REASON, never a default.
    # "No arm" used to mean two different things - a considered exclusion and an
    # oversight - and they were indistinguishable, so every unmatched file was silently
    # masked by the smoke fallback below and the verdict read PASS for an unrelated
    # suite. The *) arm at the bottom fails loudly and NAMES any file no arm claims;
    # the smoke fallback after the loop is for ignored docs/config-only changes ONLY.
    # To exempt a path, add an arm here with the reason it needs no suite.
    # WARNING, learned the hard way (agents-9nir review, three instances in one bead): a
    # path grep cannot prove a path class is consumer-free, because a file can be consumed
    # WITHOUT BEING NAMED - by a WALKER (agents/*/SKILL.md via check_docs.py's os.walk),
    # by a GLOB (targets/*.yaml via lib/scheduler.py:140-144), and by a SUBPROCESS WITH A
    # DEFAULT PATH (tools.yaml via CONFIG_PATH / load_tool_pins in lib/tool_pins.py, read in
    # test_child_env.py's probes). Cited by SYMBOL, not by line: the line number this used to
    # name had drifted onto the FACTORY_TOOL_PINS override docstring (agents-lyqx).
    # So the reason in an ignore arm must record the SEARCH PERFORMED AND ITS RESULT,
    # never a judgement about who reads the path - a judgement is unfalsifiable, and that
    # is what made the original canvas `*.md` ignore arm's reason false.
