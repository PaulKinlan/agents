## `fleet-worktree-beads-guard.patch` (agents-5br9)

- **Target repository:** `PaulKinlan/fleet`
- **Target files:**
  - `bin/bd` (lines 208-242)
  - `tests/bd-worktree-decoy.test.sh` (new unit tests)
- **Baseline file hash:**
  `359962a02e19a94b664c6193ec415e22ad00242998264f0515e86ebb0c7956ea  bin/bd`
- **Problem Statement (agents-5br9):**
  When a linked git worktree has a local `.beads/embeddeddolt` (or `.beads/dolt`), upstream `bd`'s `FindBeadsDir` resolves the local `.beads` as authoritative because `hasBeadsDatabase` returns true, bypassing the git-common-dir fallback. `bd` then operates against an empty ledger. Any subsequent `bd dolt push` risks publishing the empty database over the shared remote.
- **Changes:**
  1. **Worktree decoy guard:** `guard_worktree_beads_decoy` function in `bin/bd` shim checks if current toplevel (or `-C <dir>`) is a linked git worktree (`[ -f "$toplevel/.git" ]`).
  2. **Loud actionable refusal:** If `.beads/embeddeddolt` or `.beads/dolt` exists in the linked worktree, refuses the command with exit code 2 and actionable diagnostic:
     `bd: REFUSED: a worktree should hold no database; a decoy here means bd will report an empty ledger and a push from it would overwrite the shared one - move <path> aside and re-run.`
  3. **Canonical checkout exemption:** The canonical checkout (`.git` is a directory) legitimately holds the database and is completely exempt.
- **Verification:**
  - `tests/bd-worktree-decoy.test.sh` passes 13/13 assertions covering canonical checkout exemption, clean worktree pass-through, worktree decoy refusal, `-C` worktree decoy refusal, and recovery after moving decoy aside.
  - Regression check: `tests/bd-guard.test.sh` passes 85/85 assertions; `tests/bd-shim.test.sh` passes 11/11 assertions.
  - Clean patch application verified via `git apply --check`.
- **Hub Application:**
  ```bash
  cd ~/fleet
  git apply /path/to/fleet-worktree-beads-guard.patch
  bash tests/bd-worktree-decoy.test.sh
  ```
